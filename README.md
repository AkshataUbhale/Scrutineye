# 🕵️‍♂️ Scrutineye

## 🚀 Project Implementation
- Developed a **cloud-based web crawler** for automated data acquisition from major e-commerce platforms.  
- Implemented a **multi-stage AI pipeline** using Computer Vision (CV) to locate labels on product images and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text.  
- Utilized a **modular rule engine** to validate extracted data against the **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011**.  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** for regulators to monitor compliance scores, view violation details, and generate analytical reports.  
- Engineered a **scalable cloud architecture** to handle large volumes of product listings and ensure high availability.
